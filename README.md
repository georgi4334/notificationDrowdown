Notification Dropdown menu


- When a notification expires it should be removed from the notifications list. Some notifications do not have an expiration.

- The menu should be opened/closed by a "Notifications (0)" button which shows the number of active notifications.

 Notifications of type bonus should not be counted in the notification count badge.

- When the API returns new notifications they should be added to the notifications list

- When the API returns a response where some notifications are missing they should be removed from the list

- When the API returns new data for a specific notification it should be updated in the list
